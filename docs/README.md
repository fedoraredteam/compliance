Use the [./source](./source) directory for quick searching of source RMF documents, which are redistributed here for convenience. For latest versions, refer to the publishing organizations' websites.

Adobe Acrobat is particularly [good at this](https://www.online-tech-tips.com/computer-tips/how-to-search-for-text-inside-multiple-pdf-files-at-once/), but you could use [pdfgrep](https://pdfgrep.org/) if you want to stay in [FLOSS](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html) land.
